## Introduction

Due to the ongoing and unpredictable nature of Covid-19, our Cub Scout pack is relying on online sales to meet our fundraising goal for the year and help keep Scouting affordable for all of the families in our pack.

I put this site together to help us organize our online sales and make it easier for our Scouts to share their links with friends and families.

## How to Use

* Coming soon!

## Prerequisites

This site is designed to be lightweight and portable. It uses Bootstrap 4.5 via CDN for the layout and design. It relies only on PHP for some basic file processing. Anyone with some basic web programming skills should be able to modify this to fit their needs without a ton of work.
