## Introduction

Due to the ongoing and unpredictable nature of Covid-19, our Cub Scout pack is relying on online sales to meet our fundraising goal for the year and help keep Scouting affordable for all of the families in our pack.

I put this site together to help us organize our online sales and make it easier for our Scouts to share their links with friends and families.

You can see our live example here: http://hspack361.com/popcorn

## Prerequisites

This site is designed to be lightweight and portable. It uses Bootstrap 4.5 via CDN for the layout and design. It relies only on PHP for some basic file processing.
